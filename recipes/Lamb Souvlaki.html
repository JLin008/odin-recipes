    <h2>A popular Greek street food consisting of marinated,
        grilled lamb, typically served on a skewer or 
        in a pita bread with tzatziki sauce and other toppings</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>⅓ cup olive oil </li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless leg of lamb, trimmed of all fat and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, 
            oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.
             Add cubed lamb and stir until lamb is coated with 
             marinade. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours, or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Thread marinated lamb onto skewers, reserving any remaining marinade. Grill skewers 
            until desired doneness, 10 to 12 minutes,
             basting with the reserved marinade and turning occasionally for even cooking.
